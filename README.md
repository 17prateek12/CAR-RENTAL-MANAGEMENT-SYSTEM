# CAR-RENTAL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

My project Cab Rental System is efficient and convenient to book a cab, either to reach the destination or rent a 
car for few days. The project mainly uses the concept of OOPs to implement real-world entities like inheritance, 
hiding, polymorphism etc in our program.

The project also uses file handling to store various information regarding cabs and their specifications along 
with the availability at the moment.

It stores information such as rate per kilometre, average, Max. speed, mileage for various cars.
File handling is also used to store the Map of the city, where the rental service is currently working (in our case 
“Mumbai”).

The key feature of our project is, that it does not use the general way of storing and finding the route and 
expected distance for the user to reach his destination.

Contemporarily, it uses graph in the form of Matrix or a Vector of Vector to store the distances between few 
locations and uses this graph to find the best suited route and the shortest distance for the user to reach his 
destination from the source

4. Array 
5. Vector
6. Floyd Warshall Algorithm

I aim to create a “Cab rental service” in which the users will select the type of car they want to rent. There 
will be two section one for admin and another for the customers.

Customers will have following facilities:
• Type of car they want to rent

• Either they want a car with or without the driver

• Facility to hire car for multiple days

• User can enter the destination where they want to reach to get the shortest path and minimum fare so 
that they can compare rent with other models of car available


Admin will have following facilities:

• Only authorize person with valid id or password can enter this section

• They can add or remove the cars from their service.

• They can access the records of the customers.

• They can change the rental for the cars.
